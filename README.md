Biopolymers such as nucleic acids and proteins exhibit dynamic backbone folding, wherein
site-specific intramolecular interactions determine overall structure. Proteins then
hierarchically assemble into supramolecular polymers such as microtubules, that are robust yet
dynamic, constantly growing or shortening to adjust to cellular needs. The combination of
dynamic, energy-driven folding and growth with structural stiffness and length control is
difficult to achieve in synthetic polymer self-assembly. Here we show that highly charged,
monodisperse DNA-oligomers assemble via seeded growth into length-controlled
supramolecular fibers during heating; when the temperature is lowered, these metastable fibers
slowly disassemble. Furthermore, the specific molecular structures of oligomers that promote
fiber formation contradict the typical theory of block copolymer self-assembly. Efficient
curling and packing of the oligomers – or ‘curlamers’ – determine morphology, rather than
hydrophobic to hydrophilic ratio. Addition of a small molecule stabilises the DNA fibers,
enabling temporal control of polymer lifetime and underscoring their potential use in nucleic-
acid delivery, stimuli-responsive biomaterials, and soft robotics.
